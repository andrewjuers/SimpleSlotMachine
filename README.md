Project Description:

The "Simple Slot Machine" game is a basic simulation of a slot machine, where players can spin the reels and potentially win based on the combination of symbols that align on the machine's display. This Java project aims to create an engaging and interactive slot machine experience. Players will interact with the game by initiating spins, and their outcomes will depend on the random generation of symbols on the reels.

Key Features:

Reel Spinning: Players can initiate spins to set the reels in motion, simulating the experience of a real slot machine.
Symbol Combinations: Define various symbols that can appear on the reels, creating different winning combinations.
Winning Logic: Implement a logic system that determines whether a spin results in a win based on the alignment of symbols across the reels.
Exception Handling: Handle cases of insufficient funds, ensuring players cannot spin without an adequate balance. Validate user input to prevent invalid actions or unexpected errors during gameplay.
Unit Testing: Develop unit tests to validate the random generation of symbols on the reels. Write tests to ensure proper handling of exceptions, including cases of insufficient funds and invalid input.
Optional Enhancements:

Multiple Paylines: Introduce multiple paylines for more complex winning combinations.
Jackpot Feature: Implement a jackpot feature that provides a chance for a larger, special win.
Sound and Visual Effects: Enhance the gaming experience with sound effects and visual animations during spins and wins.
Project Goals:

Create a fully functional Java application that simulates a basic slot machine game.
Implement reel spinning, symbol combinations, and winning logic.
Ensure robust exception handling to manage scenarios like insufficient funds or invalid input.
Develop comprehensive unit tests to validate the reliability of the game's core functionalities.
Skills Developed:

Java programming
Random number generation
Exception handling
Unit testing
User interface design (console-based)
Logic implementation for symbol combinations and winning outcomes
